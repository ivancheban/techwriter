You would like to start the career of a technical writer in Ukraine. Technical writers or technical communicators is a common profession abroad. There are dedicated educational and certification institutions in many countries but unfortunately none in Ukraine.

Fortunately, there are lots of useful materials on the web. There are professional tech writer communities where experienced technical writers will be happy to advise you on the first steps of mastering this profession. I recommend Technical writers of Ukraine groups on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2030718170543759/):

and [Telegram](https://t.me/TW_Ukraine):

You can join them without any invitation. Do not be shy to ask for advice in those groups. There are many job announcements in those groups from IT recruiters. Maybe you could try to send them your resume and write the test.

First, what are the advantages of becoming a technical writer? In Ukraine, it's one of the ways to be part of IT crowd, _"enter the IT"_ as they say. Next, you can shift to business analytics or even product owner roles. At my previous company, one of my colleagues who was technical writer became a business analyst and another technical writer became a product owner at the same company. Their salaries were adjusted accordingly. You could become a lead technical writer who manages a team of other technical writers as it happened in my case. Technical writer's salary in Ukraine can start from $600-700 and increase with gaining a professional experience. In one year, your salary may be $1000 or more. You can view the salaries collected by [DOU](https://dou.ua/) [here](https://jobs.dou.ua/salaries/#period=dec2018&city=all&title=Technical%20writer&language=&spec=&exp1=0&exp2=0).

What skills should you have to become a technical writer? You don't need to be a software developer and learn Java or Python programming languages. You will write about software developed by others. You don't need to write novels with a sophisticated English like [Jane Austen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen). Quite the contrary, you will need to use a simple and clear English to explain complex technical things in the plain language. See the [example of Microsoft user guide](https://download.microsoft.com/download/3/6/B/36B6331E-0C63-4E71-A05D-EE88D05081F8/surface-hub-user-guide-en-us.pdf) written by professional technical writers. You will need to use some screenshot tool to provide illustrations for your user guides or other documentation. [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) is one of the most popular tools among tech writers for such purpose. There are many others. Of course, professional tech writers use professional tools for writing their documents. Sometimes they still use Microsoft Word or Google Docs but such tools are considered to be very simplistic. [MadCap Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/help-authoring-tool/madcap-flare/?gclid=CjwKCAjwsIbpBRBNEiwAZF8-z7-Te9ZsxbCTlSCqcvIyUiK56BFUKVyTvbwrIjjW-THl5pJk_wtOmBoCaBMQAvD_BwE) is the example of a professional tech writing or help authoring tool. You can use it for 30 days in a trial mode. However, such tools as MadCap Flare, Robohelp, DITA require a long learning curve and are not easy to understand at a glance. Today there is a trend to use much simpler and cheaper tools for technical writing using [Markdown](https://medium.com/technical-writing-is-easy/markdown-in-technical-writing-96e818816be9) and [static site generators](https://www.sitepoint.com/static-site-generators/).

In the beginning you would like to google more about technical writing on the web: [Technical Writing Blog](https://clickhelp.com/clickhelp-technical-writing-blog/) is one of such resources with many articles about tech writer's world. There is a good online training course for the beginners: [Technical Writing: Documentation on Software Projects](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/technical-writing-software-documentation?clickid=ztXUVVWzQxyJTOE0Mrw2-RyDUklWsHzBAzeeTU0&irgwc=1&mpid=1141595&utm_source=impactradius&utm_medium=digital_affiliate&utm_campaign=1141595&aid=7010a000001xAKZAA2) or [Technical writing for beginners](https://www.udemy.com/tech-writing-for-beginners/?couponCode=TW_DISCOUNT) (in Ukrainian).
